GoogleMusicWrapper for HP Touchpad!

I just put together a litte wrapper app for Google Music on the Touchpad. It is a very simple app to use Google Music on the Touchpad. It is basically only an Enyo webView that displays play.google.com/music. You can also do that in the browser of course, but the app has 2 main advantages: It supports exhibition mode and it keeps the screen on, when the app is open! 
Probably the smallest app ever "written". Feel free to use it for other "Viewers".
